        title:"Sindhudurg Fort",
        description:"Another historical masterpiece in Maharashtra is the Sindhudurg Fort in the Konkan district. The Fort was built during the reign of Chatrapati Shivaji, and that's why it has now become an emblem of his heroic acts and courage. Unlike other marine forts, the Sindhudurg stands on a rocky island, located a few kilometers off the coast of Malvan. Reaching this place is very easy as you have to rent a boat.The Sindhudurg fort has many enigmatic tales, like the three water reservoirs, which never dry during the summers. This underground water passage opens to a village at the other end, the hidden entrance gate, or the Dilli Darwaja, and so on. The finesse of the Fort has left many tourists gobsmacked, with wide, open mouths in shock. Shivaji hired three hundred architects from Portugal to construct a fortification that would be their main operational center during any war. So, visiting this Fort is a must.",

        title: "Vijaydurg Fort",

It was built in a way where the surrounding forty-kilometer shallow creek made the structure impenetrable.Laterite stones were mainly used in the construction of this Fort. There is a vast guard wall surrounding the Fort, and standing at a distance of 200km from the main building. This wall acted as the first line of defense for the Maratha naval force. Apart from this, you will also see the marks and dents left by the cannonballs on the outer wall.",

The Suvarnadurg Fort is the main structure coupled with a little land fort present on the same island.The Fort's foundation is mainly built from the rocky surface of the island itself. However, some sections are there where large stone blocks have been used.
